# bcftools_consensus errors 

# Usage:   
# need to make an indexed vcf file to make other bcftools commands happy: BCFTOOLS_INDEX
# bcftools call creates a new vcf file that has consensus bases: BCFTOOLS_CALL 
# need to make an indexed cons.vcf.gz file to make other bcftools commands happy: BCFTOOLS_INDEX
# bcftools consensus will output a fasta file containing new draft consensus sequence based on called variants: BCFTOOLS_CONSENSUS (${mask}, ${refseq}, ${indexed-vcf-file}) 

# Problem: 
# mask and refseq file input fine. indexed cons.vcf.gz file causing issues. 

# Failed Solutions: 
### 1
